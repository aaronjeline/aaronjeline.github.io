interesting or useful. My only rule is that I have to have actually read

 Programming Language
Theory/Type Theory
</h2>
<p>
 Resources on the formal definitions of programming languages and type
systems. While real languages are always more than theoretical models,
it’s essential to ground in these models. You can prevent making
mistakes that have been made before, have consistency in your design,
and make sure that your type system actually guarantees something.

Foundations

    The first two volumes have you learning the Coq proof
assistant and build up to your formalizing and proving things about
simple imperative and functional languages, as well as a simple type
system and all of the basic extensions. It’s a great foundational text.

   Part 3
  </a>
  A guide to
thinking about what undefined behaviour means. An important quote form
the article:
 </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  It is very common for people to say — or at least think — something
like this: The x86 ADD instruction is used to implement C’s signed add
operation, and it has two’s complement behavior when the result
overflows. I’m developing for an x86 platform, so I should be able to
expect two’s complement semantics when 32-bit signed integers overflow.
THIS IS WRONG. You are saying something like this: Somebody once told me
that in basketball you can’t hold the ball and run. I got a basketball
and tried it and it worked just fine. He obviously didn’t understand
basketball.

  Explains a lot of the optimizations that undefined behaviour
enables. If you’re a language safety advocate (like me), it’s important
to understand this.
