 This past week I attended the 25th USENIX Security conference. I had
a great a time and met a bunch of wonderful people. Wanted to take a bit
and gather my thoughts on the work I saw presented.
</p>
<h2 id="conference-format">
 Conference Format
</h2>
<p>
 This year, USENIX adopted a new format. Most talks were only three
minutes long, with a couple of selected talks extended to twelve
minutes. Poster sessions for all talks immediately followed the talks.
This was … okay? Three minutes is really not enough time to do much more
than present a verbal abstract. I don’t think I got anything from any of
the three-minute talks beyond “hey, maybe I should read that paper”. On
the other hand, I really enjoyed having the poster sessions so close to
the talks. Having questions fresh in mind made for some great
discussions with authors.
</p>
<h2 id="fuzzing">
 Fuzzing
</h2>
<p>
 My reason for attendance was to keep up to date with fuzzing
research, and boy was there a lot of it. Before I dive into specific
papers, two general observations. Firstly, it’s really a shame that the
fuzzing and PBT worlds don’t talk to each other more. Coverage-guided
fuzzing is clearly an empirically very good search strategy for finding
test cases, but the fuzzing literature seems stuck on only searching for
violations of a few blessed properties (usually memory safety via ASan).
Additionally, the amount of work that started with the sentence
“generating non-textual input with fuzzers is hard” surprised me, given
that the PBT and parametric fuzzing communities have worked hard on this
problem for years. (Shoutout to the excellent work by Rohan Padye and my
colleague Vasu Vikram on bridging this gap). Secondly, boy is
differential testing big! Now I’ll go through a selection of the work I
found interesting:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/you">
   My
ZIP isn’t your ZIP: Identifying and Exploiting Semantic Gaps Between ZIP
Parsers
  </a>
  - Diff tested ZIP parsers, revealing a smattering of bugs in
popular ZIP implementations and finding that no two ZIP parsers actually
parse the same format. I appreciated the speaker directly calling out
the need to abandon Postal’s law if we’d like to have secure systems.
The also found that the differences in parsing can be used to defeat
content scanning systems.

  <a href="Fuzzing%20the%20PHP%20Interpreter%20via%20Dataflow%20Fusion">
   Fuzzing
the PHP Interpreter via Dataflow Fusion
  </a>
  *. Neat work that uses
dataflow graphs as the genetic representation of programs for fuzzing.
They define mutation operators on these dataflow graphs. They’ve also
put in some great legwork integrating this into the CI for the PHP
project, and show continual ability to find bugs. It does make me wonder
what the thread model for bugs in a language interpreter (beyond certain
notable JS-shaped exceptions) is? I’m already asking it to run
arbitrary, un-sandboxed code?

   ELFuzz:
Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer
Space
  </a>
  - Neat paper along the line of work of using language models
to improve fuzzing. The conventional wisdom seems to be that using the
LLM to generate test cases won’t work for speed reasons (although some
counterexamples here!). This work explores using the LLM to generate the
generator. In particular, it evolves the generator with several
prompt-based mutation strategies, evaluates the new generators on a
coverage metric, and selects for N generators that optimize the metric.
Seems like this could be especially useful integrated with PBT.

   RangeSanitizer:
Detecting Memory Errors with Efficient Range Checks
  </a>
  - Not really a
fuzzing paper but fuzzers are gonna like it. Improvement on ASan
performance that doesn’t lose any bug-finding precision. Clever encoding
of red-zones that makes checking really fast. About a 2x speed up on
ASan, which means faster fuzzing which means more bugs found. Still
likely too slow for production use, sadly.

  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/xiao-jifan">
   Robust,
Efficient, and Widely Available Greybox Fuzzing for COTS Binaries with
System Call Pattern Feedback
  </a>
  - Clever idea, using system calls as
the feedback mechanism instead of coverage. Doesn’t require
instrumentation, and authors claim the metrics correlate well.

<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/cai-yi">
   Vest:
Verified, Secure, High-Performance Parsing and Serialization for
Rust
  </a>
  - Very nice piece of practical formals methods work! Bringing
an Everparse like system to Rust via Kani. Parsers generated here are a
little bit more flexible than Everparse’s, and they verify much
faster.

  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/hu-yiwei">
   SoK:
Automated Vulnerability Repair: Methods, Tools, and Assessments
  </a>
  - A
nice SoK on language model based automated patching. Includes a nice
dataset.

   The
DOMino Effect: Detecting and Exploiting DOM Clobbering Gadgets via
Concolic Execution with Symbolic DOM
  </a>
  - Learned about a new exploit
here, hadn’t seen DOM Clobbering before. The basic gist is:
  <ul>
   <li>
    The DOM is a global namespace
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Scripts may read from that namespace in order to construct security
sensitive values, like URLs that will subsequently be queried
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Attacker controlled scripts can race to shadow those values, leading
to attacker control of the URLs
    <br/>
   </li>
   <li>
    Paper contains a Concolic execution engine for finding DOM
clobbering opportunities.
    <br/>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  I’ll update this as read more! The three minute format makes it hard
to catch cool insights from topics where you aren’t familiar with the
research area.

<p>
 Bunch of neat papers here I’m not qualified to comment on!
 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/bosamiya">
  TRex:
Practical Type Reconstruction for Binary Code
 </a>
 uses structural type
inference to construct types from decompiled programs. I really liked
the insight that true type reconstruction isn’t actually possible, you
might as well give up and try for something else! It reminded me of an
insight we had working on 3C, and this can really unlock cool work.

 All in all, this was a super fun event! Met a bunch of great people.
Thanks to all the organizers and presenters and I hope to attend next
year!
