## About Me

I'm a computer science researcher in the field of Automated Reasoning.
My principal vision is exploring how we can develop computer systems
that are orders of magnitude more trustworthy than our current designs.
My current research focuses on:

- Programming Language Theory/Design
- Formal Verification 
- Automated Testing 
- Security

I currently work as an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services, in the
Automated Reasoning Group. 
I'm working on developing program reasoning at scale, using both
traditional static analysis, automated reasoning, language models, and
random testing.
Previously, I worked on [Cedar](cedarpolicy.com), which is a DSL for writing authorization
rules, as well as outlining a new software engineering workflow we call
"Verification-Guided Development".
I'm also deeply interesting in computing history, and developing a better vision of why our systems evolved the way they did.

I help run the wonderful [DC Systems](https://dcsystems.xyz), which is a
local meetup to chat about systems, performance, testing, and formal methods.
If you'd like give a talk, please reach out!
