## About Me

I'm a computer science researcher in the field of Programming Languages and
security. I currently work as an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services, in the Automated Reasoning Research Group. My main focus right now is a language called [Cedar](https://cedarpolicy.com), which is a DSL for writing authorization policies, as well as a new development methodology we call "Veficiation-Guided Development". My research interests are formal verification, automated testing, and language design. I'm also deeply interesting in computing history, and developing a better vison of why our systems evolved the way they did.
